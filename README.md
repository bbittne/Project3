# Project3

• Brief description of the app and its purpose.
This is it, the grand finale extraordinaire! For this project I will be taking everything learned throughout the semester and compiling it into one compact, neat, and efficient R-Shiny Application. The basis for the application is Stock Trading Data with a focus on the Microsoft Corporation. The app will not only shed some light on the stock data, but it will also allow you to do custom stock predictions. How cool is that!

• A list of packages needed to run the app.
An application this awesome couldn't have been possible without some help. I used the following packages in this application:
	shiny, tidyverse, caret, shinythemes, DT, tree
	
• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).
install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "caret", "shinythemes", "DT", "tree"))

• The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
shiny::runGitHub("Project3", "bbittne")
